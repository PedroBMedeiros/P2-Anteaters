# P2 Anteaters

Welcome to our Trimester 3 Night Hawk Planner Project. 

We are creating an online planner that consists of a to do list, and a dynamic number that lists the amount of things that needs to be done. The user will be able to create an account. We will be pulling information that will be shown on specific dates on the calendar, like holidays or games in a specific sport.

## Technical Requirements

- Python
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask
- React
- Raspberry Pi
- HTML/CSS

``Kenzie``: [Commit](https://github.com/PedroBMedeiros/P2-Anteaters/commit/28c264e5d921c1bed5ed72bc7192a478d82515b3#diff-878936e3665e0b47f880076edd0a10f6fc5eb7a473927a0aa374c7e3b4384def)

For point 1 I created my new class with the corresponding objects inside of my personal route. For the second point I defined a class on line 5 name "Intro", I am using this route to store information about my name and also any other data I might want to add in the future. I also created an object out of this class for the third point. This object was created on line 8. For the fourth point I display the data by passing my object in as a jinja variable so that I can display it on my page. For the final point, one thing that I became aware of when doing this was the flexibility of classes, I found it really interesting, easy and important that I could quickly add new data whilst also staying very organized.

``Anthony``: [Commit](https://github.com/PedroBMedeiros/P2-Anteaters/commit/5d118ec501ffdb1e1a44c4a9b8cabc5a0d740239)

For the first task, I created a personal blueprint under /Anthony. I then proceeded to create a class called Info, which allowed me to complete my next task in creating an object as I was able to convert my class into an object. I finished this off by making the object into a jinja variable and rendering it. I would say the thing I am most proud of is the simplicity of it all as I was able to answer all of the requirements and create a functioning system with only a few lines of code. 

``Pedro``: [Commit](https://github.com/PedroBMedeiros/P2-Anteaters/commit/25d000ebbcc0a873786496ccd679c14615de1b45#diff-568470d013cd12e4f388206520da39ab9a4e4c3c6b95846cbc281abc1ba3c959)

For the **first binary point**, I built a new class with the associated objects within my personal route -- For the **second binary point**, on line 6, I defined a class called *Intro*. I'm using this route to store information about my name as well as any other information I may want to add in the future -- For the **third stage**, I made an object out of this class. Line 8 is where this object was made -- For the **fourth point**, I show the data by making my object a jinja variable, which allows me to show it on my page -- My **WOW** for this check-in was that I was able to add a real time clock to the navbar on the website. -- [Practice Test](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iRuTxr_HcBfSpD-JJubtWPwv1-Jk5tKrxsIrzKTXIqY/edit). Since we now have tranferred to using react, me and Anthony have each created a route to simplify the crossover's experience when creting their connection to our project and vice versa.

``Naweid``: [Commit](https://github.com/PedroBMedeiros/P2-Anteaters/commit/0d6076d1f8b38a3fe1132bc776d27234df28e879#diff-912f2989dafca53eafd7e883ae77456faaef67846d74dd560016ff15b9ccf709R2-R12)

For the first point, I created a new class in my blueprent under routes.py. For the second point, I was able to define/enhance this class by naming it intro, which I can use to create an object out of. Forthe third point, I was able to create the object out of the class "intro" on line 8 where it states "intro=Intro()." For the fourth point, I was able to display the data by making it a jinja variable. For the last and final point, my wow factor is that I was able to concise my code in order to make the code simple, efficent, and get the points needed.
