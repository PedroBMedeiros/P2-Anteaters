# P2 Anteaters

Welcome to our Trimester 3 Night Hawk Planner Project. 

We are creating an online planner that consists of a to do list, a dynamic calendar, and a dynamic number that lists the amount of things that needs to be done. The user will be able to create an account. We will be pulling information that will be shown on specific dates on the calendar, like holidays or games in a specific sport.

## Technical Requirements

- Python
- SQLAlchemy
- Flask
- React
- Raspberry Pi
- HTML/CSS
