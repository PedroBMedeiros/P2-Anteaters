### Project Plan
#Summary: We are creating a planner that allows people better plan out their day and their tasks.

#Goals/Tasks
- Anthony: He is going to handle all the SQLalchemey and python mechanics as he is going to create the database, create a rest api, and handle the backend with the planner.
- Kenzie: She is going to work with Naweid on handling all the HTML and CSS aspects in making the project look nice and formating the planner to function better.
- Pedro: He is going to create the sign up system/login system and deploy our project as well as create a domain for our website.
- Naweid: He is going to work with Kenzie on handling the HTML and CSS aspects and he is going to help Pedro with the login system.

#Milestones:
- We plan on completing these tasks and the main base line for our project on april 18
- After we finish these goals we are going to further expand on our HTML aspects and add more features in the settings as well as add more variety to the users accessibility
  - This should take us about three weeks to accomplish
- After all this we are going to use the remaining four weeks to try and add a notifications feature to our website within google chrome that reminds the user what tasks they have at particular times. We are also going to work on creating a depthful easter egg page

## Goals
An easy and efficient way for students to organize themselves from week to week, and to avoid procrastination and facilitate learning.
